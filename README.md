# Malware: A Comprehensive Guide

An immersive and visually stunning single-page guide to understanding malware. This project, built with pure **HTML** and **CSS**, serves as an educational resource that explains what malware is, its types, how it spreads, and how to protect against it, all presented in a modern, cyberpunk-inspired design.

## 🌟 About The Project

This project was created to be a comprehensive and engaging educational guide on the topic of cybersecurity, specifically focusing on malware. The goal was to build a visually rich, interactive, and modern-looking website from scratch, using only fundamental web technologies (HTML and CSS) to push the boundaries of what can be achieved without frameworks or JavaScript.

The design features a dark, futuristic theme with dynamic animations, 3D elements, and a clear, structured layout to make complex information easy to digest.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Mastered

This project was a deep dive into advanced CSS and modern web design principles. Key skills and concepts I implemented include:

*   **Advanced CSS Styling:**
    *   **Custom Properties (Variables):** Used CSS variables for a maintainable and consistent color scheme.
    *   **Flexbox & Grid:** Implemented complex, responsive layouts for various sections.
    *   **Animations & Transitions:** Created engaging user experiences with custom `@keyframes` animations (like the floating shield and glowing text) and smooth transitions on hover.
*   **Modern Design Principles:**
    *   **Cyberpunk/Futuristic UI:** Crafted a unique visual identity using specific fonts (`Orbitron`, `Fira Code`), color gradients, and glowing text effects.
    *   **Glassmorphism:** Used `backdrop-filter: blur()` to create a "frosted glass" effect on the navigation bar and cards.
    *   **3D & Depth Effects:** Integrated 3D-rendered images and used `box-shadow` to create a sense of depth and hierarchy.
*   **Responsive Design:** Wrote detailed **Media Queries** to ensure the website is fully responsive and provides an excellent experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
*   **Pure HTML/CSS Implementation:** Demonstrated the ability to build a feature-rich, modern website without relying on any JavaScript frameworks or libraries.
